            <p>This is a detailed paragraph demonstrating how content can be presented inside a div container.
                Here, we can add multiple sentences to explain a topic, provide information, or simply test
                how text looks with styling applied through CSS. The container ensures that the content remains
                organized, visually appealing, and readable. You can continue adding more text to simulate
                real-world content scenarios like articles, blog posts, or product descriptions.</p>
